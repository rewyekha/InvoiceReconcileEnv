# 🧾 InvoiceReconcileEnv

> An OpenEnv environment for training and evaluating AI agents on real-world Accounts Payable invoice reconciliation workflows.

---

## Motivation

Every company — from a 10-person startup to a Fortune 500 — processes vendor invoices. The standard verification process, called **three-way matching**, cross-checks an invoice against its Purchase Order and Goods Receipt to confirm that what was ordered, received, and billed all align. Done manually, this is slow, error-prone, and expensive. Companies like SAP and Oracle charge millions to automate it.

**InvoiceReconcileEnv** creates a rigorous, reproducible training ground where AI agents learn to do exactly what a real AP clerk does — extract invoice data, verify it against ground-truth records, detect discrepancies and fraud patterns, and make payment decisions — all under efficiency pressure.

---

## Environment Description

The agent operates as an AP clerk inside a simulated Accounts Payable department. It processes invoices one at a time from a batch, using a realistic set of workplace actions to gather information and make decisions.

**Key mechanics:**
- **Partial observability** — agent must explicitly request PO and receipt data, just like a real clerk pulls records from a system
- **OCR noise simulation** — hard mode introduces realistic text errors (`"lndustrial Widget"`, `"G1obal Parts Co"`) that agents must reason through
- **Tolerance bands** — price variance ≤ 2% is acceptable (approve), > 5% must be flagged; grey zone (2–5%) requires judgment
- **Duplicate detection** — same invoice submitted twice with slightly different amounts and the same PO reference
- **Partial shipments** — goods receipt shows fewer units than invoiced; agent must flag and not approve
- **Priority invoices** — early payment discount windows create time pressure, but never override correctness
- **Fraud patterns** — invoice bank account mismatches PO vendor bank account; requires escalation

## Action Space

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `extract_fields` | `invoice_id` | Extract all structured fields from the current invoice. Always do this first. |
| `retrieve_po` | `invoice_id` | Fetch the matching Purchase Order record for price and quantity comparison. |
| `retrieve_receipt` | `invoice_id` | Fetch the Goods Receipt to verify delivered quantities. |
| `flag_discrepancy` | `invoice_id`, `discrepancy_type`, `reason` | Flag an issue. Types: `price`, `quantity`, `duplicate`, `vendor`, `tax`, `other`. Advances to next invoice. |
| `approve_payment` | `invoice_id`, `amount` | Approve invoice for payment. Advances to next invoice. |
| `reject_invoice` | `invoice_id`, `reason` | Reject the invoice outright. Advances to next invoice. |
| `escalate` | `invoice_id`, `reason` | Escalate to human manager. Required for fraud signals and unknown vendors. Advances to next invoice. |

Every action costs a step. Redundant or repeated actions incur a penalty. Efficient, direct reasoning is rewarded.

## Tasks

### 🟢 Easy — Single Invoice Reconciliation
**Invoices:** 1 | **Expected score:** 1.000

A single clean invoice requiring straightforward three-way matching. Agent must extract fields, retrieve PO and receipt, confirm everything matches, and approve. Tests basic comprehension and action sequencing.

**Grader:** Correct final decision (approve/flag/escalate) on the single invoice. Partial credit for information-gathering steps.

---

### 🟡 Medium — Batch Invoice Processing
**Invoices:** 3 | **Expected score:** 1.000

A mixed batch with three conditions:
- **INV-101**: Clean match → approve
- **INV-102**: Price variance of 25% (agreed $20, invoiced $25) → flag as `price`
- **INV-103**: Partial shipment — 80 of 100 units received → flag as `quantity`

Tests multi-step reasoning and pattern recognition across a batch.

**Grader:** Per-invoice decision accuracy averaged across all 3. Partial credit for correct discrepancy detection with wrong type label.

---

### 🔴 Hard — Complex Batch with Fraud Detection
**Invoices:** 5 | **Expected score:** 1.000

A noisy, ambiguous batch with every real-world complication:
- **INV-201**: Clean match with OCR-noisy description → approve
- **INV-202**: Price variance of 1.67% (within soft tolerance) → **must approve**, not flag. Traps naive agents.
- **INV-203**: Duplicate invoice — same PO reference as INV-201, slightly different unit price → flag as `duplicate`
- **INV-204**: Priority invoice with 2% early-payment discount + partial shipment (60 of 100 received) → **flag as `quantity`** regardless of discount temptation
- **INV-205**: Fraud signal — vendor ID is V003 but invoice bank account (`BANK-ACC-FRAUD-999`) doesn't match PO bank account (`BANK-ACC-003`) → escalate

Tests: tolerance band reasoning, duplicate detection, multi-objective decision making under time pressure, and fraud pattern recognition.

**Grader:** Composite score across all 5 invoices. Efficiency penalty if >80% of 40 steps used. Priority bonus if discount captured on valid approval.

## Design Decisions

**Why Accounts Payable?** It's a billion-dollar automation problem with clear ground truth, natural partial observability, and deterministic grading. Every discrepancy is either present or not — no subjective scoring.

**Why OCR noise?** Real AP systems process scanned documents. Agents that only handle clean text fail in production. OCR noise is seeded and reproducible so grading remains deterministic.

**Why tolerance bands instead of exact matching?** Real AP policies allow small price variances (typically 1–3%) to avoid holding up payment for rounding errors. Flagging a 1.67% variance is a mistake in practice — this tests whether the agent learned policy, not just comparison.

**Why the priority invoice trap?** A 2% discount sounds compelling, but never approve a partial shipment regardless of incentives. This tests whether the agent prioritizes correctness over optimization.
